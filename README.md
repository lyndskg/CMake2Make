# CMake2Make

CMake2Make is an innovative coding project that aims to provide users with a user-friendly tool to convert CMakeLists.txt files to Makefiles and vice versa for C++ projects. CMake2Make simplifies the process of switching between build systems, allowing developers to seamlessly transition between CMake and Makefile configurations, depending on their project requirements or preferences. The tool will automatically analyze the CMakeLists.txt or Makefile files, parse the necessary information, and generate the corresponding build system configuration, enabling smooth and efficient build management for C++ projects.

Key Features:
1. CMake to Makefile Conversion: CMake2Make will efficiently convert CMakeLists.txt files to equivalent Makefile configurations, preserving the build settings, compiler flags, and target information.
2. Makefile to CMake Conversion: The tool will convert Makefiles to CMakeLists.txt files, ensuring that the CMake configuration reflects the original Makefile structure and build options.
3. User-Friendly Interface: CMake2Make will offer an intuitive and user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) to guide users through the conversion process with ease.
4. Customization Options: Users will have the flexibility to customize the generated Makefiles or CMakeLists.txt files according to their specific project needs, allowing for seamless integration with existing projects.
5. Cross-Platform Support: CMake2Make will support various platforms and operating systems, ensuring compatibility and consistency across different build environments.
6. Error Handling and Validation: The tool will include error handling and validation mechanisms to detect and report potential issues during the conversion process, ensuring the integrity of the generated files.
7. Build System Switching: CMake2Make enables developers to switch between CMake and Makefile-based build systems effortlessly, catering to their development workflows and preferences.


Basic Workflow:
1. User Input: CMake2Make will prompt users to provide the path to the CMakeLists.txt or Makefile file they wish to convert.
2. File Analysis: The tool will analyze the provided file, extracting relevant build configurations, compiler options, and target information.
3. Conversion Process: Based on the analysis, CMake2Make will generate the corresponding Makefile or CMakeLists.txt file with equivalent settings and configurations.
4. Customization (Optional): Users will have the option to modify the generated file to suit their specific project requirements, such as adding or modifying compiler flags, external libraries, or include directories.
5. Seamless Integration: The converted build system file can now be integrated into the project, allowing developers to compile and manage their C++ code effortlessly.


Project Goals and Advantages:
1. Enhanced Flexibility: CMake2Make empowers developers to switch between build systems effortlessly, offering greater flexibility in project management.
2. Time Savings: By automating the conversion process, developers can save time and effort in manually rewriting build configurations for different build systems.
3. Improved Collaboration: The tool promotes better collaboration within development teams by accommodating different build system preferences and standardizing project structures.
4. Platform Agnostic: CMake2Make supports cross-platform projects, ensuring consistent build processes across various environments.


CMake2Make will be a valuable asset for C++ developers seeking a streamlined approach to manage build systems for their projects. It bridges the gap between CMake and Makefile-based configurations, providing an efficient and user-friendly solution for build system conversion.
